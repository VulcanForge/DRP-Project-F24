Feedback on Assignment 1:
	Notice that recursion will cause multiple sieves to be constructed.
	You could avoid this by creating the sieve separately from the factoring function, then use recursion.

Assignment 2:
	Write a C program to determine which of the following numbers is prime and which is composite.

	Challenge: factor the composite number.
	(You are not expected to know how to do this unless you read ahead. Please don't just stick it in Wolfram though :)
